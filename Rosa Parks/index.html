                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="intro">Rosa Parks, the "Mother of the Civil Rights Movement," epitomizes courage and resilience. Born on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, her refusal to surrender her bus seat in December 1955 sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott, dismantling racial segregation. Parks' words echo her commitment: "I wanted to be free so others would be also free." Her story is a testament to individual actions igniting transformative change. Today, we honor her legacy and draw inspiration for a world where equality and justice prevail.</p>
